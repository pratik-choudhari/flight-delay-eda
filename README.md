# flight-delay-eda
Using data available on kaagle.com, I have tried to create an exhaustive EDA on the data.

## Setup
1. Download data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/divyansh22/flight-delay-prediction). After extracting move the 2019 CSV files in `data/` folder.
2. Install requirements.txt, perform following on terminal.
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open the ipynb file in jupyter notebook and add more features!
